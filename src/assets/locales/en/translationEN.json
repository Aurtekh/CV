    "text": "I'm interested in writing code and then seeing the result of my efforts. I started to learn programming languages from school, such as Pascal, Delphi. In my university years I got acquainted with C++. But I always wanted to dive into WEB-development, so I settled on learning the JavaScript programming language. In my spare time from programming I play the piano, do sports and go hiking."
